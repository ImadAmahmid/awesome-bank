<h3 align="center">Awesome Banking App</h3>

</div>

A banking up built quickly yet with love to Exalt IT Dojo, using Java 17 and Spring Boot 3 (Spring 6) with multiple layers, each set in a separate module for decouplingâ€™s of concerns and more flexibility of implementation sake.
In this readme you will find how to navigate the project as well as how to run using either java or inside of a docker container as a microservice.

# How to run:
If you run using docker compose you can benefit from a microservice architecture instanciating two
instances of the bank service with postgres database. The nginx server load balancer will split the traffic 
to target the two instances behind. Please check out the readme within the docker 
compose folder in order to find the step by step guide.

You can also run using Intelliji! If you do not the swagger generator plugin install and configured 
you can spin up a mvn install first to generate these resources for you.

Third way of running the project is using a plain old java after a :

```
mvn clean install

java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=postgres ./application/target/bank-application.jar
```
Once that's done you can access the application swagger doc here and make some tests:

[Swagger definition localhost URL](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#)

# Acrhitecture details: 

### Bank-domain:
Contains the business logic of the banking app.  

### Bank-dal
Contains an implementation of the persistence layer using JPA.
The entities and repositories will be nested in this project 
as well as the mappers to convert these entities to domain objects.

### Bank-api 
Contract first driven module, that takes care of the generation of the API 
resources from a swagger file. These resources will be implemented by the api-bank
module and call the adapter layer, the adapter will then 
reach to the services of the bank-domain and map the result back to the api.

### Bank-security 
A new module to ensure the communication with the server is secure. The security is
done through a registering of user at the application load when dev profile is active.
The users are stored in an in memory cache, but a user repository would be a nice thing 
to have in the future.
This module also exposes an end point to authenticate. The users are user, admin & manager and 
they all have a very strong password (password) 
It will be a nice thing to add also a new end point to register users dynamically and 
persist the user in a database.

### Bank Application module
A small module that will spin up the spring boot app, enables the swagger api
and expose our API for everyone!
The application can run either with a postgres database or for a quick spin up using h2 embedded db.
The auditing is also enabled by default, this way we can track every operation back to its issuer!

You can use the spring profiles: h2 , postgres for this purpose

### Nice to have later:
Add tracing to logs via a filter 
Add validation to operations
Add security layer allowing Admins only to create accounts

### Enhancements
Remove the newBalance from the AccountOperations response
